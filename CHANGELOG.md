## 3.0.0
__19.12.2021__

- Implemented new interface-based entity model.
  > All concrete implementations of entities are now hidden behind interfaces which exports only behavior which is
  > intended for end developer usage. For example: User is now not exported and its interface `IUser` is available for developers.
  > This change shouldn't have impact of end developers.
- Implemented basic plugin system for reusable framework plugins (Currently available plugins: Logging, CliIntegration, IgnoreExceptions)
  > INyxx now implements `IPluginManager` inteface which allows registering plugin via `registerPlugin`. Developers can create their
  > own plugins which can access various hooks inside INyxx instance. For now plugins system allows hooking up to
  > `onRegister`, `onBotStart` and `onBotStop`.
- Improved cache system. Cache abstractions provided by nyxx are now compatible with `MapMixin<Snowflake, T>`
  > `SnowflakeCache` now implements `MapMixin<Snowflake, T>` and is compatibile with Map
- Allowed running bot as REST only. It enables extensions that only require nyxx entities and http capabilities.
  > Internals of nyxx were rewritten to allow running entirely in REST mode without websocket connection.
  > Previously similar behavior was available but wasn't working as intended.
- Implemented ITextVoiceTextChannel.
  > Discords beta feature `chat in voice channels` was implemented in form of `ITextVoiceTextChannel` interface
- Added support for Guild Scheduled Events
- Do not send auth header when it's not needed
- Added support for Dart 2.15
- Fixup message update payload deserialization
- Implement multiple files uploads. Fixes #226
- Implement missing webhook endpoints. Fixes #235
- Implement get thread member endpoint; Fixes #234
- Implement edit thread channel functionality; Fixes #247
- Fix few message update event deserialization bugs
- Fix TODOs and all analyzer issues

Other changes are initial implementation of unit and integration tests to assure correct behavior of internal framework
processes. Also added `Makefile` with common commands that are run during development.
